[SPEAKER_00] Christian's 22 and it ish.
[SPEAKER_02] At the break, have you not got this on a spreadsheet
[SPEAKER_02] and you just laminate it and put it up at the seating area of every holiday we go on?
[SPEAKER_00] Or put on Google Sheets whenever this question comes up.
[SPEAKER_00] I think Lou Beth must have been 2003.
[SPEAKER_00] You would have been 10.
[SPEAKER_00] That would have been 10.
[SPEAKER_00] We've all been touched up.
[SPEAKER_00] Are you on beer and pims?
[SPEAKER_03] I'm just on beer.
[SPEAKER_00] Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03] I learnt from my mistake.
[SPEAKER_02] Whatever year, Victoria Beckham released her autobiography
[SPEAKER_02] of the year that we went to Lubas.
[SPEAKER_02] I was saying, be careful when you're going down on a new bike race
[SPEAKER_02] because this one's a very tight.
[SPEAKER_02] It nearly died.
[SPEAKER_03] There was a lot of downhill on that trip.
[SPEAKER_01] Right.
[SPEAKER_01] You just went on the other side of the road and luckily you were nothing.
[SPEAKER_03] You were very nearly...
[SPEAKER_02] If I'd been going any faster, I would have gone over the edge of the cliff.
[SPEAKER_02] I thought that's what was going on today.
[SPEAKER_01] What cliff?
[SPEAKER_01] We went down the mountain road.
[SPEAKER_02] Greg took us for a bike ride.
[SPEAKER_02] The other one was yours.
[SPEAKER_01] Oh.
[SPEAKER_01] It was never a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01] And I'd sort of give one of the downhill.
[SPEAKER_03] Yeah, those are my...
[SPEAKER_03] Those are the book ones.
[SPEAKER_03] These are the music ones.
[SPEAKER_01] But I don't think...
[SPEAKER_01] Okay.
[SPEAKER_01] I don't know what speed was all about in those days.
[SPEAKER_01] But he actually on the flight.
[SPEAKER_02] I don't think Richard's actually fucking listening.
[SPEAKER_01] Well, I didn't say that, sweetheart.
[SPEAKER_01] Sorry, what?
[SPEAKER_01] Because I prefer to think of something different.
[SPEAKER_00] Oh, well, I live with Annalise.
[SPEAKER_00] He's a wordsmith.
[SPEAKER_02] I live with Annalise, I know exactly.
[SPEAKER_01] And she went around the hairpin bend.
[SPEAKER_01] And as opposed to keeping to the inside of the hairpin, which you had to do.
[SPEAKER_02] And Dad shouted, came to the inside!
[SPEAKER_02] I remember shouting back, I can't!
[SPEAKER_01] She was actually on the gravel on the outside.
[SPEAKER_01] I can't remember if there's a barrier or not, but actually there was quite a steep road on the inside.
[SPEAKER_02] There was a barrier.
[SPEAKER_02] I very clearly remember there being a barrier.
[SPEAKER_03] Willow, will I come here and settle down?
[SPEAKER_03] I'll be going in in a minute.
[SPEAKER_02] That's my most prevalent near-death experience I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_01] Willow, sit.
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah, it will be called.
[SPEAKER_00] Charlie and Barney have obviously done a lot of hikes slash walks with me,
[SPEAKER_00] so they know my problems with legs and my burks.
[SPEAKER_00] And I told them for the first time they'd never heard the I hate my leg story.
[SPEAKER_00] And they were like, that is the most nudge bird story I've ever heard.
[SPEAKER_00] And I thought, I know.
[SPEAKER_02] I would have minded it the other day.
[SPEAKER_02] We went somewhere and we're like, I hate my legs, I hate my arms, I hate my arms.
[SPEAKER_02] And I was like, Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_01] No.
[SPEAKER_01] Whoever had this before?
[SPEAKER_01] Rihanna.
